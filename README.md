This extension allows you to apply hierarchical numbering to blocks on a Roam Research page.

This might be useful if you're writing a book and you need numbered headings for each section.

This gif shows it in action:

If you also have the SmartBlocks extension installed (and you should, it's awesome!), this extension will create a Refresh Numbered List SmartBlock on a Numbered List Extension page. When you use the Command Palette to create a numbered list, a Refresh button will be inserted before your page content. This will allow you to refresh the numbering if you move sections around.

If you don't have the SmartBlocks extension, there won't be a Refresh button generated. You would need to refresh by using the Command Palette.

This extension will work for blocks up to six levels deep in an indented structure.
