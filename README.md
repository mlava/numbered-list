This extension allows you to apply a hierarchical numbering to blocks on a Roam Research page.

This might be useful if you're writing a book and you need numbered headings for each section.

This gif shows it in action:

Note that it will generate a Refresh button at the top of the page and if you move blocks around and then click refresh the numbering will be automatically corrected.

This extension will work for blocks up to six levels deep in an indented structure.
